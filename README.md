## Blackjack Project

### Overview
This project facilitates a user playing the game Blackjack with the computer. This projects demonstrates Abstraction Polymorphism Inheritance and Encapsulation. This program serves as the dealer and allows the user to play as many games as he or she wishes.

## Technologies Used
* UML
* Java
* Enums
* Object Oriented design
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Abstraction

## Lessons Learned
* Separation of concerns: How to isolate functionality
* UML: How to plan the coding project. Method signatures, inputs, outputs, app flow.
* Abstraction: Separating the details of the functionality from the function. Planning the project using UML greatly facilitated this process.
* Polymorphism: Using a common parent class for the dealer and player classes allowed me to implement different functionality and re-use code.
* Inheritance: This allowed me to pass down functionality from the player class to the dealer class.
* Encapsulation: Only the "Dealer" class had a private list of cards. By using encapsulation I was able to isolate access to the card deck to the code that needed to access it.
